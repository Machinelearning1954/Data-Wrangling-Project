- **Lagged Features:** For time-series forecasting, lagged versions of stock prices or returns (e.g., previous day\"s close, return from  T-1, T-2 days) are often crucial. These can be created using `.shift()`.
- **Interaction Features:** Combining stock-specific features with macroeconomic features (e.g., stock volatility during high/low GDP growth periods, though this requires careful definition).
- **Date-based Features:** Extracting month, day of the week, quarter from the \"date\" column might be useful for some models to capture seasonality, though for daily stock data, more direct time-series models are common.

Standardization (e.g., using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to give data zero mean and unit variance) or Normalization (e.g., `MinMaxScaler` to scale data between 0 and 1) is often a preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. 

The choice of whether and how to scale data depends on the specific algorithm being used. For instance, tree-based models are often insensitive to feature scaling, while distance-based models (like KNN, SVM) and neural networks usually benefit from it.

For this data wrangling stage, we will not apply scaling yet, but it\"s an important consideration before model training. We would typically apply scaling only to the training set and then use the fitted scaler to transform the test set to avoid data leakage."""

The visualizations provide insights into:
- **Stock Trends:** AAPL\"s adjusted close price shows an upward trend over the 5-year period, with fluctuations. Moving averages help smooth out short-term volatility and indicate longer-term trends. Trading volume varies, with spikes potentially corresponding to significant news or events. Daily returns are centered around zero, with some periods of higher volatility.
- **GDP Trends:** US Nominal GDP shows a consistent upward trend. The YoY GDP growth rate fluctuates, showing periods of economic expansion and contraction (e.g., a dip around 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic).
- **Distributions:** The distribution of daily returns appears somewhat leptokurtic (fat tails), common for financial returns, indicating a higher probability of extreme values than a normal distribution. Adjusted close prices show a multi-modal distribution reflecting price levels over time.
- **Correlations:** The example correlation matrix provides a quantitative look at linear relationships. For instance, `adjclose` is highly correlated with its moving averages (as expected). The correlation between daily stock metrics and annual GDP/GDP growth is generally low, which is also expected given the difference in data frequency and the multitude of factors affecting stock prices daily.

These visualizations confirm the data is behaving as expected for financial and macroeconomic series and that the cleaning and feature engineering steps have produced reasonable results.

1.  **Data Collection:**
    *   **AAPL Stock Data:** Fetched via Yahoo Finance API (`YahooFinance/get_stock_chart`). This is a reliable source for historical stock data. Daily data for 5 years was chosen to capture sufficient history for time-series analysis while remaining manageable.
    *   **US GDP Data:** Initially attempted via World Bank API (`DataBank/indicator_data`). An API authentication failure led to sourcing the data from a CSV download from the World Bank data portal (`API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_85078.csv`). This maintained the goal of using a disparate, authoritative source for macroeconomic context. The specific indicator (Nominal GDP in current USD) was chosen for its direct relevance to economic scale.

2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   **AAPL Stock Data:**
        *   *Missing Values:* Handled by forward-filling (ffill) then backward-filling (bfill) for OHLC and adjusted close prices. This is a common approach for financial time series, assuming prices carry over during non-trading periods or brief data gaps. Volume NaNs were filled with 0, assuming no trades. Rows with critical missing data (e.g., date, close) after filling were set to be dropped, though ffill/bfill typically handles most cases in dense stock data.
        *   *Outliers:* No explicit outlier removal was performed on stock prices. Financial data can have legitimate large jumps (e.g., due to earnings announcements, market shocks). Standard outlier removal techniques (like IQR or Z-score based) might incorrectly remove valid data points. The focus was on handling missing data and ensuring correct data types. Visual inspection of price and return plots did not reveal obvious erroneous outliers that would necessitate removal beyond what the source API provides.
    *   **US GDP Data:**
        *   *Reshaping:* The raw CSV data was in a wide format (years as columns). It was reshaped into a long format (Year and GDP_USD columns) using `pd.melt` for easier analysis and merging.
        *   *Data Types:* Year was converted to numeric. GDP_USD was converted to numeric, with non-convertible values becoming NaN.
        *   *Missing Values:* Rows with missing GDP_USD values after conversion were dropped. For annual data, interpolation could be an option if gaps are few and internal, but dropping ensures we only use reported figures.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   AAPL stock data (daily) was merged with US GDP data (annual) using a left merge on the `Year` column. This ensures all stock data points are retained, and the corresponding annual GDP is mapped to each day of that year. This is a standard way to combine data of different frequencies when the lower-frequency data provides context for the higher-frequency data.

4.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Stock-Specific Features:**
        *   `daily_return`: Percentage change in adjusted close price. Fundamental for financial analysis.
        *   `MA7_adjclose`, `MA30_adjclose`: 7-day and 30-day moving averages of adjusted close. Common technical indicators to smooth price data and identify trends.
        *   `volatility30`: 30-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns. Measures price variability.
        *   `adjclose_lag1`: Previous day\"s adjusted close price. Essential for many time-series forecasting models.
    *   **GDP-Specific Features:**
        *   `GDP_growth_YoY`: Year-over-Year percentage change in GDP. Provides a measure of economic momentum.
    *   **Date-based Features:**
        *   `month`, `day_of_week`: Extracted for potential seasonality analysis, though their utility depends on the chosen model.
    *   *Handling NaNs from Feature Engineering:* NaNs generated by `pct_change()` and `rolling()` (at the start of the series) were filled with 0. This is a simplification; in a rigorous modeling scenario, one might drop these initial rows or use more sophisticated imputation if the period is critical.

5.  **Data Visualization:**
    *   Visualizations were used to explore trends, distributions, and relationships (e.g., stock price over time, GDP growth, return distributions, correlation matrix). These plots helped confirm that the data transformations were sensible and that the data exhibits expected characteristics (e.g., stock price trends, GDP growth cycles, fat tails in returns)."""

*   **Completeness:** Missing values have been addressed in a reasoned manner. The primary stock data is quite complete after ffill/bfill. GDP data is annual, so its application to daily stock data results in repeated values for GDP within a year, which is an accepted way to incorporate lower-frequency macro data.
*   **Consistency & Accuracy:** Data is sourced from reputable providers (Yahoo Finance, World Bank). Transformations (reshaping, merging) were checked for logical consistency. Calculations for engineered features (returns, MAs, growth rates) are standard. The visualizations did not reveal inconsistencies that would question the accuracy of the transformations.
*   **Relevance:** The chosen features (stock OHLCV, returns, volatility, MAs, GDP, GDP growth) are relevant for analyses that might involve predicting stock movements or understanding their relationship with macroeconomic indicators. The merging of disparate data sources (stock market and national economic data) enhances the dataset\"s richness for such tasks.
*   **Structure for ML:** The final dataset is in a tabular format (CSV), with each row representing a trading day and columns representing various features. This is a standard structure suitable for many ML algorithms. Timestamps are available, which is crucial for time-series modeling.
*   **Limitations & Further Considerations:**
    *   *Outlier Handling for Stocks:* As mentioned, a more sophisticated domain-specific approach to outlier detection for stock prices might be considered in a production system, though it\"s often complex.
    *   *Stationarity:* For time-series forecasting, features (especially the target variable like price or return) often need to be stationary. This was not explicitly addressed in the wrangling phase but would be a key step in pre-modeling data preparation (e.g., by differencing prices, or using returns which are often more stationary).
    *   *Look-ahead Bias:* Care was taken in feature engineering (e.g., using `pct_change()` and `rolling()` without future data) to avoid look-ahead bias. When creating lagged features, `.shift()` correctly uses past data.
    *   *GDP Data Granularity:* Using annual GDP data for daily stock analysis means the GDP figure is constant for all trading days within a year. While this provides context, higher-frequency economic indicators (e.g., quarterly GDP, monthly unemployment) could offer more dynamic macro insights if the modeling goal required it.
    *   *NaN Filling for Engineered Features:* Filling initial NaNs from rolling calculations with 0 is a simple approach. Depending on the model, dropping these rows or using a more careful backfill/interpolation might be preferred to avoid introducing artificial zeros.

**Overall, the data wrangling process has resulted in a dataset that is significantly cleaner, richer, and better structured for potential machine learning applications compared to the raw sources. The decisions made were aimed at balancing thoroughness with practicality for this capstone project, demonstrating an understanding of common data wrangling techniques and considerations.**"""
